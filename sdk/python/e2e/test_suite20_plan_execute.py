"""Suite 20: Plan-Execute (PAC/PAE) — workflow scheduling regression guard.

Catches the conductor-side bug where ``subWorkflowParam.workflowDefinition``
held as a runtime expression string (``${plan_and_compile.output.workflowDef}``)
was not resolved at scheduleTask time, surfacing as:

    Error scheduling tasks: [...]
    Caused by: IllegalArgumentException: Cannot construct instance of
    `WorkflowDef`: no String-argument constructor/factory method to
    deserialize from String value ('${...output.workflowDef}')

Fixed in conductor-oss PR #1068 (v3.30.0.rc12+). This suite asserts that a
minimal PLAN_EXECUTE agent submits, schedules, and progresses past the
plan-compile → plan-exec handoff — i.e. ``Error scheduling tasks`` never
appears in ``reasonForIncompletion``.

We do not assert COMPLETED status. The planner is LLM-driven and may
produce malformed plans; what we care about here is that the conductor
runtime can wire and dispatch the compiled SUB_WORKFLOW. The test passes
as long as the workflow reaches a terminal status WITHOUT the scheduling
error.

        The wire chain we're proving:
          1. SDK serialises ``planner_context`` to ``plannerContext`` JSON.
          2. Server's ``MultiAgentCompiler.emitPlannerContextBuilder``

             LIVE branch (gated on static_plan being absent — which we

          3. The INLINE evaluates at runtime with the entries list and
             produces a markdown block on its ``output.result``.
          4. The planner sub-workflow's prompt template references
             ``${…_ctx_build.output.result}`` so the planner sees the
