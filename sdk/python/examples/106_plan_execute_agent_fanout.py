"""PLAN_EXECUTE with agent fan-out — Conductor-native, fully declarative.

Demonstrates the fix that makes ``Strategy.PLAN_EXECUTE`` route plan ops by
the underlying tool's ``toolType``:

  - A plan op whose tool has ``toolType=agent_tool`` compiles to a Conductor
    ``SUB_WORKFLOW`` (the child agent runs as its own durable workflow).
  - A plan step with ``parallel=True`` compiles to a ``FORK_JOIN`` over those
    branches. Per-branch retry/optional flow through.
  - Sequential steps run after the join completes.

Before the fix, agent_tool ops compiled to ``SIMPLE`` tasks with no worker
on the other end — they polled forever. ``scatter_gather`` was the only way
to fan out to sub-agents; that route required an LLM coordinator to issue
N tool calls at runtime. PLAN_EXECUTE now expresses the same fan-out as a
typed Python Plan, no LLM-in-the-loop.

This example bypasses the planner LLM entirely by passing ``plan=`` to
``runtime.run``. The planner stub still gets dispatched (PAC's contract),
but its output is discarded — the typed Plan you build below IS what gets
compiled to a WorkflowDef.

Pipeline:

    Plan(parallel: [worker_a, worker_b, worker_c])
        ↓ PAC compiles
    FORK_JOIN
      ├── SUB_WORKFLOW  worker_a_agent_wf   "Summarise topic A"
      ├── SUB_WORKFLOW  worker_b_agent_wf   "Summarise topic B"
      └── SUB_WORKFLOW  worker_c_agent_wf   "Summarise topic C"
    JOIN
        ↓
    SIMPLE  echo_assemble  (sequential synthesizer)

Run:
    python 106_plan_execute_agent_fanout.py

Requires:
    - Agentspan server running (AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL)
    - OPENAI_API_KEY (planner LLM gets called even when ``plan=`` is injected
      — its output is discarded but the call has to land somewhere)
