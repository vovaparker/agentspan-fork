"""Plan-Execute Harness — deterministic execution of LLM-generated plans.

Demonstrates Strategy.PLAN_EXECUTE: a planner agent produces a structured plan
(DAG of operations), which is compiled into a Conductor workflow and executed
deterministically. LLM is only invoked per-operation where it adds value
(generating content, writing code). Orchestration is pure Conductor.

This example builds a research report generator:
    planner → plan_executor (deterministic) → fallback (if validation fails)

The planner:
    - Takes a topic and decides what sections to research/write
    - Outputs a Markdown plan with an embedded JSON fence
    - The JSON describes a DAG: research (parallel) → write sections (parallel) → assemble

The executor (compiled from JSON plan):
    - Static operations (create dirs, assemble files) run as direct tool calls
    - Generated operations (write sections) get parallel LLM calls
    - Validation checks the report exists and meets word count

If validation fails, the fallback agent gets the plan + errors and fixes things.

Architecture:
    planner (agentic LLM)
      ↓ writes plan with JSON fence
    plan_executor (deterministic Conductor workflow)
      ├── step: setup (static: create output dir)
      ├── step: write_sections (parallel: LLM generates each section)
      ├── step: assemble (static: concatenate sections)
      └── validation: check word count
      ↓ on failure
    fallback (agentic LLM, bounded)

Usage:
    python 85_plan_execute_harness.py "The impact of AI agents on software development"
    python 85_plan_execute_harness.py "Climate change mitigation strategies for 2030"

Requirements:
    - Agentspan server with PLAN_EXECUTE strategy support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set (or defaults to openai/gpt-4o-mini)

PLANNER_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""\
You are a research report planner. Given a topic, plan a structured report.

Your plan should:
1. Use 3-5 sections (introduction, 2-3 body sections, conclusion).
2. Put section files under ``sections/`` (e.g. ``sections/01_intro.md``).
3. Run section writes in parallel after a setup step that creates the directory.
4. Assemble the sections into ``report.md`` once writes complete.
5. Validate the result with ``check_word_count`` (min {MIN_WORD_COUNT} words).

Each section should be 150-300 words. Use the ``generate`` block on
``write_file`` ops so the LLM produces content at run time; static args for
``create_directory`` and ``assemble_files``.
"""

FALLBACK_INSTRUCTIONS = f"""\
You are fixing a report that failed validation. The plan was already partially \
executed but something went wrong (missing sections, word count too low, etc.).

Review the error output, figure out what's missing or broken, and fix it.
You have access to read_file, write_file, assemble_files, and check_word_count.
