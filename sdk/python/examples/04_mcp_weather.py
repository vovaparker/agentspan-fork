"""MCP Weather — using Conductor's MCP system tasks for live weather.

Demonstrates the `mcp_tool()` function which uses Conductor's built-in
LIST_MCP_TOOLS and CALL_MCP_TOOL system tasks. The MCP test server
provides deterministic weather data, and the Conductor server handles all
MCP protocol communication — **no worker process needed**.

Flow:
    ListMcpTools → LLM (picks tool) → CallMcpTool → Final LLM

MCP Test Server Setup (mcp-testkit):
    pip install mcp-testkit

    # Start without auth:
    mcp-testkit --transport http

    # Or start with auth (requires storing the secret as a credential):
    mcp-testkit --transport http --auth <secret>

    # Store credentials via CLI or Agentspan UI:
    agentspan credentials set MCP_TEST_API_KEY <secret>

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - mcp-testkit running on http://localhost:3001 (see setup above)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

Docker gotcha:
    When the AgentSpan server runs in Docker (e.g. `agentspan server start`),
    the *server* makes the MCP calls — not your local process.  The server
    resolves `localhost` to its own container loopback, not your host machine.

    Fix: use `host.docker.internal` so the container can reach your host:

        weather = mcp_tool(server_url="http://host.docker.internal:3001/mcp", ...)

    DNS rebinding protection: mcp-testkit rejects unknown Host headers with
    HTTP 421. If you hit this, patch the validation in the venv that the
    mcp-testkit process uses:

        sed -i '' \
          's/return Response("Invalid Host header", status_code=421)/return None/' \
          $(python -c "import mcp.server.transport_security as m; print(m.__file__)")
