"""115 — Plan-Execute with ``planner_context``: customer onboarding plan.

The PAE planner's static ``instructions`` string is fine for *how* to
emit a plan, but it's a poor fit for the domain-specific rules a
real plan depends on — tier thresholds, KYC step ordering, region
exceptions, escalation rules. Those live in docs that change weekly,
not in code.

``planner_context`` solves this: a list of text snippets and/or URLs
appended to the planner's user prompt as a ``## Reference Context``
block on every planner invocation. URLs are fetched dynamically — no
compile-time fetch, no cache — so a Confluence edit lands on the next
plan run with zero redeploy.

Example shape::

    Agent(
        strategy=Strategy.PLAN_EXECUTE,
        tools=[...],
        planner=...,
        planner_context=[
            # 1) Inline rules — short, stable, never changes mid-quarter
            "Onboarding has 3 phases: KYC, account_setup, welcome_email.",
            "Tier 'enterprise' customers also require a kickoff_call step.",

            # 2) Live doc — fetched per planner invocation, edits go live
            Context(
                url="https://confluence.example.com/onboarding/rules",
                headers={
                    # Same ${CRED} placeholder shape as ToolConfig.headers —
                    # one credential pipeline, server escapes ${} → #{} and
                    # the runtime resolver fills the value at request time.
                    "Authorization": "Bearer ${CONFLUENCE_TOKEN}",
                },
                required=True,
                max_bytes=8192,
            ),
        ],
    )

This example runs WITHOUT a real Confluence backend — the
``planner_context`` is text-only by default so you can run it against
a stock server without setting up credentials. The Context(url=…)
example above is commented in the code below as a reference for how
real installations wire credentialed docs.

What to look for in the run:
  * Workflow status reaches a terminal state.
  * The compiled inner plan_exec contains one task per declared
    onboarding tool — ``validate_kyc``, ``create_account``,
    ``send_welcome_email``.
  * The planner's prompt contains the ``## Reference Context``
    block. The compiled workflow's ``_ctx_build`` INLINE produces
    the markdown that gets templated into the planner's user message.

Requirements:
  - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api (default)
  - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini (default)
